# isomorphic-react-app-ts

Another React app boilerplate. The two most important are that everything is in TypeScript and that it supports server side rendering from the beginning.

## Basic ideas

- Good development support
- Everything TypeScript
- Opinionated folder structure
- CSS Modules and File Loader for structural component support
- 

## Wishlist

[ ] Hot Module Replacement for both client and server side
[ ] CSS Modules
[ ] Builtin i18n support
[ ] Redux
[ ] React Router 4, ReactRouterRedux 5
[ ] Redux-Forms
